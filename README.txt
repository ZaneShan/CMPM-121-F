## Tools and Materials

### Engines, Libraries, Frameworks, and Platforms
We plan to use **Godot**. Godot has a lot of built-in functionality, and we do not perceive the need for outside libraries or frameworks.

### Programming and Data Languages
We plan to use **C#** and **GDScript**. GDScript is built for Godot and has extensive functionality for game development.

### Tools for Authoring the Project
- **IDE:** VSCode, because it is what we are accustomed to.  
- **Image Editor:** Aseprite, as we plan to create pixel art and already own Aseprite.  

### Alternate Platform Choice
Our alternate platform will be **Unity**, as it differs significantly from Godot. It relies more heavily on **C#** or **C++**, rather than GDScript.

## Outlook

### Unique Goals
Our team aims to challenge ourselves by programming in **GDScript**, an unfamiliar language, despite being more comfortable with **C#**. This sets us apart as most teams might stick to what they know best.

### Anticipated Challenges
The most difficult part of the project will be the **learning curve**:
- Adapting to a new engine, **Godot**.
- Learning and applying **GDScript**, Godot’s scripting language.

### Learning Objectives
We aim to:
- Master scripting with **GDScript**.
- Familiarize ourselves with Godot’s unique **scene system** and **user interface navigation**.  
If time permits, we plan to:
- Create custom sprites and assets in **Aseprite** and import them into the game.
