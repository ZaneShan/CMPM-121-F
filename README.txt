#1 Devlog Entry - 11/15/2024

## Introducing the team
Tools Lead: 
	Zane Shan
Engine Lead: 
	James Yim
Design Lead: 
	Leif Tanner

## Tools and materials
Tell us about what engines, libraries, frameworks, and or platforms you intend to use, and give us a tiny bit of detail about why your team chose those.
	We plan to use godot, godot has a lot of built in functionality and we do not perceive the need for outside libraries or frameworks.
Tell us programming languages (e.g. TypeScript) and data languages (e.g. JSON) you team expects to use and why you chose them. Presumably youâ€™ll just be using the languages expected by your previously chosen engine/platform.
	We plan to use C# and GDScript, GDScript is built for godot and has a lot of built in functionality for game development.
Tell us about which tools you expect to use in the process of authoring your project. You might name the IDE for writing code, the image editor for creating visual assets, or the 3D editor you will use for building your scene. Again, briefly tell us why you made these choices. Maybe one of your teammates feels especially skilled in that tool or it represents something you all want to learn about. 
	We plan to use VSCode for our IDE, and the image editor we plan to use is Aseprite. We are using VSCode because it is what we are accustomed to, and Aseprite because we plan to make pixel art and already own Aseprite.
Tell us about your alternate platform choice. Remember, your alternate platform must differ from your primary platform by either changing the primary primarily language used or the engine/library/framework used for building your user interface.
	Our alternate platform will be unity, it is a different platform and will code more in C# or C++ rather than GDScript.

## Outlook
What is your team hoping to accomplish that other teams might not attempt?
	While you can use C# to program in Godot, we will be using its native GD Script. C# would be comfortable for us as that is the primary language of Unity, but we are challenging ourselves to code in an unfamiliar language. 
What do you anticipate being the hardest or riskiest part of the project?
	I anticipate that the most difficult aspect of the assignment will be the learning process of learning a new engine, we have cumulative experience in other engines such as Unity, Unreal Engine, and Phaser, but have never tackled creating a project in Godot. Learning GD script, Godots scripting language. 
What are you hoping to learn by approaching the project with the tools and materials you selected above? 
	We are hoping to learn how to script with GD script, and be familiar with its unique scene system and user interface navigation. If we have Have enough time and are capable of scoping beyond what is required for this project, we would like to create unique sprites and assets in Aseprite and import them into the game.
